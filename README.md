# Sentiment-Analyzer
This project is a lightweight sentiment analysis application that classifies user-provided text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face. It features a clean and interactive Gradio web interface, and automatically utilizes a GPU if available for faster inference.
